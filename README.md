# macos-firmware-chrultrabook-ARCHIVED
Archived version of ethanthesleepyone's MacOS Firmware builds for the Chrultrabook Project.



This is an archive of ethanthesleepyone's MacOS firmware builds, after he took them down following the results of the American 2024 Presidential Election. I do not hold his political views nor want any politics involved in this archival project. THe builds are all downloaded from Wayback Machine's April 2024 archived page of his site, I am unable to access anything more recent. If I ever have enough time to do it, I might start creating my own builds for more up-to-date versions of MrChromebox's script. This README will probably never be updated, so enjoy!
